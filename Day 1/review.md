* Numbers = any number w/o quotes

* Objects including instances of data types, can have properties, stored info
	* Properties denoted with a `.` after name of object i.e `'Hello'.length`
* Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions
* Methods called by appending object or instance with `.`, the method name, and brackets i.e `'hello'.toUpperCase()`
